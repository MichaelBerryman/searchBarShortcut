Mozilla Firefox Web Extension to add a shortcut "/" to move focus to the current page's search bar.  If there's currently any text highlighted, then that will be added to the search bar.

Icon made from (which I belive are both free icons):

Tested on Google, Github, stackoverflow, Wikipedia, developer.mozilla.org

Note will not work on certain Mozilla domains as no extensions will run there, e.g. addons.mozilla.org or about:addons
Doesn't seem to work on Chrome's google home page - not sure why

Tested in Firefox 60, Chrome 65, Opera 52

name='q' for google, and is a common default, note Github, uses q, but also has it's own search shortcut of / or s

placeholder^='search' for (Icons source) - but feels a little ropey:
